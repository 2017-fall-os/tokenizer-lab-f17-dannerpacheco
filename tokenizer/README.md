In this lab we made a tokenizer. It takes input from the user and breaks it down by words. It prints each word in a new line. I could not get the exit command to work. 

To run this program:

$ make
$ ./test


I got help from Ana Garcia to use the read and write functions.
I helped Jose Yanez with debbuging copying strings to vector and with printing the vector.
We came up with ideas together initially, but did not share work on anything else.
